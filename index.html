                                <p>My journey to coding life begins today at hacktiv8. On the first day, I met many new faces across the B classroom where the kickoff event held. Kickoff was held to give the students study materials, procedure, and regulation off Phase 0. The event was hosted by Mr. Hary Dimas.<br><br>After the kickoff end, I went home to study new material about making simple website using HTML and do some excercise that provided by hacktiv8. I learned the material by following instruction at codeacademy. Learning HTML in codeacademy was my first assignment for this week.</p>

                                <p class="day-p">On tuesday, I tried to do my next assignment which was learning to design web site using CSS on code academy and also do some excercise along the way. After two days learning to use HTML and CSS to make a website, it's time to relax my mind by playing some games with my friends and some good sleep.</p>

                                <p class="day-p">On wednesday, I went to hacktiv8 to attend lecture about using terminal command and git. By using terminal in linux based OS or MacOS,  in my case is Ubuntu, we can easily browse our computer directory. Not only for finding items but terminal also can making new folder or items at such ease. Just using some simple command and our new item or folder will be created. Using terminal will saving some time and ram for doing the same thing than do it by normal process. <br><br>I also learn abaout git and github where we can store our code, revise it, event colaborating with other developer. Not only lerning about terminal command and git, we also given a group project to do for next friday. So my group decided to split the work among our member, and I get to do the feature part of the website.</p>

                                <p class="day-p">On thursday, I do my best to made the feature part of the website for our group project. I use my knowledge and do some research along the way when I do the coding of the page. At first, I struggled to do the positioning part of the body section. But after some time struggling I kinda pulled it off. </p>

                                <p class="day-p">On friday, me and my team do some revision on our group project before we do our website presentation in front of the class. It's a bit nerveous to do the presentation, because I don't know what kind of response that we will get from our website. At 02:00 PM the presentation begun and our group is the fourth group to present our presentation. When presenting our presentation some technical issue occur but we can manage to do our presentation quite smoothly. Every other group has shown good website so the presentation duration become so long and we get home quite late.</p>
